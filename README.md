# ListViewWithSubListView

In mobile applications we often have lists to display, this is easy only if the list contains a simple and not complex structure.  This project demonstrates how we create a complex Expandable ListView with a sub ListView in  Xamarin.Forms.. This Expandable List allows user to Expand and Collapse items via a simple click. We have a list of hotels and each hotel contains a list of rooms. One click on a hotel will display its rooms while a double click will collapse it.
